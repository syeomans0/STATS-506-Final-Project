# Final Project for STATS 506 at Umich
This project will use publicly available data from the General Social Survey (GSS), conducted by the National Opinion Research Center, which is associated with the University of Chicago.

The main research question will be as follows: Using the GSS, how has confidence in major U.S. institutions changed between pre-pandemic (2015-2019) and post-pandemic (May 2023–2024)? Further, does this trend differ by race or sex, and does the party of the sitting President moderate these changes?
